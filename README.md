# Enhanced Multicast Protocol for Low-power and Lossy IoT Networks (EMPL) - Proof of Concept Implementation

This repository contains the proof of concept implementation for the EMPL and MPL in Contiki-OS 3.x.

## Overview:

1. MPL Engine Integration:
  To incorporate the new "MPL" engine, modifications are required in three specific files. The updated files can be located in the "other folders to replace" folder. Follow the standard procedure for adding a new engine.
2. Trickle Timer Versions:
  Three versions of Trickle Timer (Opt-, Short-, Trickle) are available in the "Trickle timer" folder.
3. MPL Contiki Implementation:
  The "MPL Contiki implementation" folder contains the MPL implementation tailored for Contiki-OS.
4. EMPL Modes and Versions:
  Explore individual folders for the code corresponding to each EMPL mode and version.
5. Simulations:
  Nodes and topology used in the paper's simulations are documented in the "Simulation" folder.

For further details, refer to the EMPL article to ensure accurate execution and effective utilization of the provided codebase.
